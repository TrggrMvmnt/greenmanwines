AM0001,zorah,Zorah Voskí,"From the Vayots Dzor wine-making area of Armenia comes this delightful white made from Voskèak and Garandmak, grape varieties indigenous to the region. Grapes come from old vines grown on Phylloxera free soils at altitude of 1400 meters, close to Mount Ararat. Alberto Antonini, the oenologist at Zorah Wines, says about Voskí: “Vibrant, juicy and layered with beautiful acidity that comes from the high altitudes. The floral and spicy notes give way to a full-bodied white and the final blend is like a symphony on one’s palate.”",***,publish,no,no,visible,,instock,yes,no,35.95,,75 cl,taxable,23%,variable,White,"conventional, white, dry, unoaked, high-altitude",Armenia,Vayots Dzor,,Alberto Antonini,13%,AM0001.jpg,armenia|vayots_dzor|voskèak_garandmak,Armenia,Vayots Dzor,"Voskèak, Garandmak",2014
AR0001,hormigas_malbec,Altos Las Hormigas Malbec,"Winemaker’s notes: “The joyful and fresh expression of Mendoza is in this Malbec. Red fruits, cherries and a soft note of plums that have just been picked up from the tree. This wine is all about freshness. The palate is supple and juicy, inviting to en- joy glass after glass. Soft but structured tannins and a pleasant finish. Three words can describe this Malbec perfectly: freshness, joy and vitality. Can be paired with light fare or heavier dishes, but also can be enjoyed alone.”",***,publish,no,no,visible,,instock,yes,no,19.95,,75 cl,taxable,,variable,Red,"conventional, red, dry, full-bodied, high-altitude",Argentina,Mendoza,,"Alberto Antonini, Attilio Pagli",13.3%,AR0001.jpg,argentina|mendoza|malbec,Argentina,Mendoza,Malbec,2015
AR0002,colome_torrontes,Bodega Colomé Torrontés,"Winemaker's notes: ""Grapes sourced in the Calchaquí Valley from 30 – 60 year old vines are harvested at optimal maturity and hand-sorted at the winery. A lingering, slow fermentation at low temperatures results from carefully selected yeasts with fermentation and aging in stainless steel tanks, without oak. For maximum freshness, the wine is aged for three months before bottling.”",***,publish,no,no,visible,,instock,yes,no,16.95,15,75 cl,taxable,,variable,"White, Biodynamic","biodynamic, white, dry, unoaked, high-altitude",Argentina,Calchaquí Valley,,Thibaut Delmotte,13.5%,AR0002.jpg,argentina|calchaquí_valley|torontés,Argentina,Calchaquí Valley,Torontés,2015
